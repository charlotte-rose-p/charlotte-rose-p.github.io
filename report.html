<h1>Charlotte Pritchard Report: IS51018A Large Coursework</h1>

<p><strong>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</strong> These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.</p>

<p>Upon researching web programmers before I created my site, I discovered Adham Dannaway’s portfolio website. He uses a white background but includes hints of bright colours to achieve a simple yet enticing effect. This made me recognise the importance of retaining a white background for some sections of my website, as it draws the viewer to important aspects of the page. I also took inspiration from Adam’s use of animations as you scroll down. This encourages the viewer to continue browsing the site, as this creativity enables the viewing experience to be more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Jordan Vitanov’s ‘made by water’ personal portfolio also uses colour to create an impact as the addition of yellow highlights relevant sub-headings in an eye-catching manner. I also took interest to the layout of this website. All sections being on one page rather than the directing to other html pages, makes the website easy to navigate and issues fluidity between the elements. The style that Jordan uses to display achievements is effective. I especially took inspiration from the use of skill bars as this presents the content efficiently.</p>
<p>I was additionally inspired by the artwork ‘Moon Bacon’, an illustration brand. I featured the design of a hand holding a Vogue magazine to form the ‘About me’ page which enforced a consistent colour scheme of red highlights. I selected this piece as the bold colours draw attention to the site. The white sections also enforce continuation to the page below.</p>

<p><strong>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</strong></p>

<p>My site is accessible through the use of alternative text. This allows the information to become available to everyone, as it can be accessed through using a screen reader. The alternative text is also accessible to technologies that cannot see the image, such as search engines.</p>
<p>Having a fixed navigation bar allows the viewer to access the various links at any given time. This means that there is no need to scroll to the top of the page in order to find another section link, it is consequently always available.</p>
<p>My site is easy to use through the clear division of sections with appropriate headings. This enables an ease of navigation for users who may have difficulty in locating different parts of the website. The fonts I have used are also sized appropriately so that the text is readable to everyone.</p>

<p><strong>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</strong></p>

<p>I considered usability by focusing on how readable my site is. I achieved this through the input of paragraph formatting and the use of white space to ensure all text can be read easily. I also added transparent boxes upon vibrant backgrounds to enhance readability.</p>
<p>I ensured links within my site to open within a new tab in order to avoid directing users from the main website. This would create confusion and make it difficult to locate back to the original site.</p>
<p>I considered the placement of information to increase the effectiveness of my website. I used columns to distribute information within the page, and insured there to be a different layout for each section. This enables the user to read as much information when scanning the page, as different layouts retain interest. I also positioned important information such as my skills in the centre of the page, so that my strengths can be a focus to professionals.</p>


<p><strong>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</strong> (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</p>

<p>When creating an image carousel within the Photography section of my site, I researched into how I could manipulate code so that the images would act as a slideshow, meaning the user would not have to select each image. I found these JavaScript functions through the Coursera online course, whereby it detailed how to create a moving image gallery. I adapted this code to function within my own gallery. Through removing the backwards and forwards buttons of my image carousel, I also discovered how to hide elements through the visibility:hidden property which I continued to use within my site. I found this through a search engine which directed me to the visibility property on W3 schools.</p>
<p>I also found out how to change the layout of my nav bar so links were positioned to the left and right, while my nav bar brand remained in the centre to act as a main focus. I researched this through stack overflow- an online community for web programmers. Here I discovered the utility classes of navbar-left, navbar-right and navbar-center, that I applied to my html code.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I had to learn how to create animated skill bars. I was made aware of the basic structure of a skill bar through using the inspect tool on Jordan Vitanov’s personal portfolio, and used html and CSS properties to alter the values and style of the skill bars. I then found the JavaScript properties through research where I discovered codepen- a website that shows editable source code.</p>

<p><strong>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</strong></p>

<p>I think the structure of my website worked well as it is divided clearly into four containers that have different row structures to maintain the interest of users. These are accurately linked through the nav bar which is fixed to be easily accessible. I think my colour scheme works effectively as the highlights of red throughout the site adds unity and draws the user to the most interesting aspects of the page, such as the animated skill bars and buttons to my journalistic work.</p>

<p><strong>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</strong></p>

<p>My website could be more responsive to mobile devices by being able to adapt all features to a very small screen. This would be done through the concentration of designing for mobile by consistently using @media queries through the construction of my site. If I was to do this again, I would focus more on mobile design from the beginning. My website could also be improved by animations such as the skill bars beginning when the user reaches that position of the page. If I was to do my website differently, I would learn and research greater JavaScript skills prior to producing my website, so I could include these additional features.</p>

<p><strong>What resources were used when creating your work?</strong> You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.</p>

<p>I used w3 schools bootstrap ‘webpage’ template as a starting guideline but adapted it in many ways. I added additional containers and included rows within each container. I also customised the nav bar by using utility classes navbar-left, navbar-right and navbar-center as well as enabling it to be fixed. I used CSS to customise the nav bar, in addition to the rest of the site such as the inclusion of transparent boxes and background images. Reference- W3 schools ‘Webpage’ bootstrap template. Available at: https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_temp_webpage&stacked=h</p>
<p>I researched how to centre a nav bar with a nav bar brand in the centre through Stack Overflow. From this I retrieved the utility classes navbar-left, navbar-right and navbar-center and adapted these into my own code.  Reference- Stack overflow. 2014 Available at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19733447/bootstrap-navbar-with-left-center-and-right-aligned-items</p>
<p>I produced my skill bars by selecting elements of code such as skill bar classes and ‘data percent’ from Jordan Vitanov’s portfolio website. I adapted this by adding additional bars and percentages, and by using an alternative CSS style and colour scheme. I also animated these bars by using the Javascript code from Code Pen. I used some style features from Code Pen’s CSS coding such as padding, and height quantities. Reference- Jordan Vitanov. Made by Water. Available at: http://www.madebywater.com/ Reference- Animated Skills Bar jQuery & CSS3. Code Pen. By Tamak. Available at: https://codepen.io/tamak/pen/hzEer</p>
<p>I found the button tag through w3 schools, and used the suggested padding for CSS styling. I customised the button myself by changing the shape of the button, the opacity, colour and transparency when it is hovered over. Reference- W3 schools. Basic button styling. Available at: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp Reference- W3 schools. button tag. Available at: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp</p>
<p>I used the visibility:hidden property from W3 schools. I used this for different functions such as hiding buttons as well as unwanted titles. Reference- W3 schools. Available at: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_visibility.asp</p>
<p>I created my image carousel using code from Coursera online course, Responsive Website Basics. I also used the JavaScript functions to form a moving image gallery. Although the majority of code comes from this source, I adapted the code through using additional first hand images, I also changed the sizing and padding of the images, and hid the buttons to create a clean effect. I was also required to adapt tags and values within the JavaScript code in order for it to work within my site. Reference- Coursera. Responsive Website Basics: Code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by University of London & Goldsmiths, University of London.
